### Back-End (Planned):

**Node.js** with **Express.js**:- API development for managing news articles, user sessions, and admin actions.
**Database**:

- MongoDB or MySQL for storing user credentials, news articles, and comments.
**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**:

- For session management and securing API routes (admin/user access control).
**Passport.js**:

- To handle OAuth authentication for both users and admins.
